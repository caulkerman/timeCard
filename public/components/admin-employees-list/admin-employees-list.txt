Styling - Make it so the Create New Employee and Terminated Employees sit above the filter input box.

STyling - Get rid of the red Cancel button and add a small X at the top right corner outside of the form.  Maybe center the submit button in the middle.

make it so under the table header Hours This Week that the hours for this employee shows up for the week.

you need to make it so the employee when terminated can be resurrected from the database.

Need to split the employees by whether they be workers or admin so that when foreman is filliing out time card he/she doesn't have access to the admin.

Styling - Make it so the Create New Employee and Terminated Employees sit above the filter input box.

STyling - Get rid of the red Cancel button and add a small X at the top right corner outside of the form.  Maybe center the submit button in the middle.

make it so under the table header Hours This Week that the hours for this employee shows up for the week.

I think that I need to consider and plan how I want to separate the admins from the employees.

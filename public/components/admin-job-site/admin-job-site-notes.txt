I changed the employee object by creating a firstName and lastName properties.  I need to make it so when adding a late time card employee that it validates correctly, need to change the new employee object, need to make it so when deleting the employee object that the if statement comparables match up.  fullName is no longer used.

Styling Modal - Make it so the ng-hide and ng-show divs have the styling of a modal.

Styling Modal - Make it so the late time event hides and shows with a button and make it look like a modal.

Styling Modal - Make it so when admin wants to change time that a modal type thingy pops up, we need to make sure that this can all fit on a phone.

Styling deleteWarning div needs to look nice.

Styling - Make the notes div look nicer as it looks pretty bad right now.

Maybe in the future make it so photos can be uploaded --- this is a wish list item right now, if I am feeling jiggy then I can go ahead and do it.

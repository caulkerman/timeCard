Styling Modal - Make it so the ng-hide and ng-show divs have the styling of a modal.

Styling Modal - Make it so the late time event hides and shows with a button and make it look like a modal.

Styling Modal - Make it so when admin wants to change time that a modal type thingy pops up, we need to make sure that this can all fit on a phone.
    
Styling Highlight the "LATE" in red.

Styling deleteWarning div needs to look nice.

Styling - In the Create Late Time Card modal make it so when the admin choses whether it is TandM that the button clicked stays a certain color.

Maybe in the future make it so photos can be uploaded --- this is a wish list item right now, if I am feeling jiggy then I can go ahead and do it.

Make it so the employee has TandM on his/her object so when deleting time cards it will delete the one chosen and not all that share the same date.  I deleted an employee from a time card, this time card shared the same date as another time card and when I reviewed the delete in the employee's hours and job sites, both were gone because they shared the same date.  Maybe make a function that creates a rondomly generated id for each time card or employee or something or other.  Using an individual id for each time entry will solve a lot of problems and shorten if statements.

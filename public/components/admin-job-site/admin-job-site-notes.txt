Make it so the ng-hide and ng-show divs have the styling of a modal.

Make it so the late time event hides and shows with a button and make it look like a modal.
    
*DONE* Make it so when admin clicks to show the timecard for a day that the date continues to show, that way the admin will have a date reference to the time card they are lookin at. 
    
Make it (MAYBE) so the hidden-daily-time-card div looks like a modal with the date in its original position, the X to hide can be in the upper right corner like normal.
    
*DONE* Make it so the admin can edit the employee hours.
    
Make it so the admin can enter a late time event time card where it hide/shows with only the notes and materials with a submit button that creates the new time card and has it call to the DB so it shows in the ng-repeat immediately.

Make it so the filter works correctly

The comments in html says to make a spot for whether the timecard is T&M, because if it IS then there would be duplicate dates, and that would be ok if it's T&M.

Make it so there is a delete button in the parent ng-repeat to delete the entire daily_time_card if an employee accidently creates an empty time card, puts no employee time and/or materials etc in it.

Make it so with the late time card that the admin can enter multiple employees and late time.

Make it so the materials_used and notes are editable

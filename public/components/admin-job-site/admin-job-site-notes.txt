Styling Modal - Make it so the ng-hide and ng-show divs have the styling of a modal.

Styling Modal - Make it so the late time event hides and shows with a button and make it look like a modal.

Styling - In the Create Late Time Card modal make it so when the admin choses whether it is TandM that the button clicked stays a certain color.

Maybe in the future make it so photos can be uploaded --- this is a wish list item right now, if I am feeling jiggy then I can go ahead and do it.

When deleting an employee from a time card when using the filter, the filter messes up the $index of the ng-repeat so that when you delete the employee, some other employee from some other time card is deleted rather than the one you want to delete.

Make it so the employee has TandM on his/her object so when deleting time cards it will delete the one chosen and not all that share the same date.  I deleted an employee from a time card, this time card shared the same date as another time card and when I reviewed the delete in the employee's hours and job sites, both were gone because they shared the same date.

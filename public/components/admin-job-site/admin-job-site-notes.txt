Styling Modal - Make it so the ng-hide and ng-show divs have the styling of a modal.

Styling Modal - Make it so the late time event hides and shows with a button and make it look like a modal.

Styling Modal - Make it so when admin wants to change time that a modal type thingy pops up, we need to make sure that this can all fit on a phone.
    
Styling Highlight the "LATE" in red.

Styling deleteWarning div needs to look nice.

Styling - In the Create Late Time Card modal make it so when the admin choses whether it is TandM that the button clicked stays a certain color.

Styling - Make the notes div look nicer as it looks pretty bad right now.

Maybe in the future make it so photos can be uploaded --- this is a wish list item right now, if I am feeling jiggy then I can go ahead and do it.

I want it so when admin clicks on a date to open the day's timecard that instead of the timecard dropping down below, it opens a modal, maybe.  Just thought that maybe it might make things difficult when admin needs to print the page.  Maybe instead have a new page or a new html template open up, like a directive.

Make it so the admin can change the date of any time card.

<p class="test">{{test}}</p>

<p>there will be a ng-repeated list of all old job sites that are in an array.  It may be set up in an un-ordered list or table.</p>
<p>inside the ul or table will be a button next to the name of the job site which will resurrect the job site and add it back to the list of jobsites.</p>

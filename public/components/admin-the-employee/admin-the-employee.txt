Create a function that adds up all the employee's time (maybe for the year or something, perhaps buttons that can do it for week, weeks, month, year).

In addition to making it so the hours add up, make it so it shows time noticably for the work week/pay period, like put a line in it or something.

working on making a way to filter employee time by week blocks, (0-6) and numbering the blocks using a counter.  I think that I may be able to use temporary arrays to put the different filters into.

should make it so admin can update/change employee details.

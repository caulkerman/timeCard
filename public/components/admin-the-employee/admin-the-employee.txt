Maybe make the employee details an ng-show or hide, think about it.

Create a function that adds up all the employee's time (maybe for the year or something, perhaps buttons that can do it for week, weeks, month, year).

Make it so when the employee has been deleted/quit/fired/retired (made "old") that the html page clears and there is a notice saying that it has been transferred to a different page.

Make it so you don't delete all hours, dates, and jobsites that share the same date when attempting to delete one.  Fix this by adding the above TandM.

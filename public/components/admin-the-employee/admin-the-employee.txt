Make it so the employee can be sent to a "No longer an Employee" array or DB collection.  In other words, make it so you can delete the employee.

Maybe make the employee details an ng-show or hide, think about it.

Create a function that adds up all the employee's time (maybe for the year or something, perhaps buttons that can do it for week, weeks, month, year).

Make it so the employee can be sent to a "No longer an Employee" array or DB collection.  In other words, make it so you can delete the employee.

Make the dates and hours_worked ng-repeat in a table with job name visible.

Make the userName on html work, it doesn't right now.

Make a filter for the dates

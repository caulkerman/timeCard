Maybe make the employee details an ng-show or hide.

Create a function that adds up all the employee's time (maybe for the year or something, perhaps buttons that can do it for week, weeks, month, year).

In addition to making it so the hours add up, make it so it shows time noticably for the work week, like put a line in it or something.

Maybe make the employee details an ng-show or hide, think about it.

Create a function that adds up all the employee's time (maybe for the year or something, perhaps buttons that can do it for week, weeks, month, year).

Make it so when the employee has been deleted that the html page clears and there is a notice saying that it has been transferred to a different page.

Make it so TandM shows up in the table so as not to confuse the admin to think there are duplicate time cards.
